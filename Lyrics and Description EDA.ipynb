    "A: Assertion statements help detect problems quickly and early on when programming. For example, some errors can fall several layers through the program before they are detected. Assertion statements catch these errors so that they do not slip into proceeding layers of code. Additionally, programmers understand that the assert condition holds true throughout the remaineder of code (as long as the assertion statement does not return errors, but errors will always be shown).
